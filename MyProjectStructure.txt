Parser:

Responsibility: The parser analyzes user input and breaks it down into meaningful components for further processing.
Tasks:
Tokenize the input: Split the user command into individual tokens.
Handle quoting and escaping: Recognize quoted strings and escaped characters properly.
Identify command structure: Determine the command, arguments, and any redirection or piping instructions.



Executor:

Responsibility: The executor is responsible for executing the parsed commands and managing the execution environment.
Tasks:
Execute external commands: Launch external programs specified by the user.
Handle built-in commands: Execute commands that are built into the shell (e.g., cd, echo, exit).
Manage process execution: Handle forks, execute commands in child processes, and handle process communication (e.g., pipes).
Redirect input and output: Implement redirections and handle file descriptors appropriately.



Builtins:

Responsibility: Handle built-in commands, which are commands that are part of the shell itself rather than external programs.
Common Builtins:
echo: Display messages.
cd: Change the current working directory.
pwd: Print the current working directory.
export: Set environment variables.
unset: Unset environment variables.
env: Display the environment.
exit: Terminate the shell.



Signals:

Responsibility: Manage signals, which are software interrupts delivered to a process.
Common Signals:
SIGINT (Ctrl-C): Interrupt process (commonly used to stop a running command).
SIGQUIT (Ctrl-): Quit process.
SIGTSTP (Ctrl-Z): Stop/suspend process.
Tasks:
Handle signal interruptions: Define how the shell responds to signals like Ctrl-C or Ctrl-D.
Implement signal handlers: Specify custom actions for different signals.
